# Beocreate 2 Design Guidelines


## Icon Glyphs

Beocreate 2 uses icons for various purposes, such as for the different extensions in menus. These icons should follow a consistent style.

- Use SVG format with a 21 x 21 pt canvas.
- Use 1 pt strokes with round end-caps and joints.
- Use outlined shapes. Only create solid shapes when absolutely necessary to convey information (fox example, the heart in Now Playing is solid when a track is a loved track).
- Don't create coloured icons. Beocreate 2 will change the colours of the icons as necessary (such as when switching from light to dark mode). You can save both black and white versions of the icon if needed.
- Aim to present the idea with as few strokes as possible, to maintain a minimal and harmonious look.

## Product Images

To create product images for use with Beocreate 2, follow these guidelines.

- The image should be a flattering, high-quality representation of the product.
- An immaculate, near-photorealistic rendering is preferred to a photograph for an iconic feel.
- Pay attention to lighting, materials and textures.
- Whilst the product will be primarily presented on light backgrounds, ensure that it works on dark backgrounds too.
- If the product is self-standing, it should have a subtle shadow.
- Within a product family, consider the relative scale of the individual products to accurately convey size.
- The entire product and the shadow must fit on the canvas without being cut off in any way.
- The image should be a PNG file with the dimensions of 1000 x 1000 pixels and a full alpha channel.

High-quality design and craftsmanship are core values of Beocreate 2, and the product images should always attempt to uphold these values.
