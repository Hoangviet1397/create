# Beocreate 2 Design Guidelines

High-quality design is a core value of Beocreate 2. Everything the user sees and touches should strive to meet the highest standards of craftsmanship. It should feel like a Bang & Olufsen product.

## User Interface & Experience

The key drivers in the design of Beocreate 2 user experience are clarity, simplicity and elegance.

### Elegant Look

Maintain the elegant, monochromatic look. The use of colour is reserved for the following instances:

- Speaker channel designations (ABCD, red, yellow, green, blue)
- Album covers and other similar content
- Product icons
- Other illustrations that are not interactive elements

The interface supports both light and dark colour schemes. Take this into account when designing any visual assets.

### Use Standard Elements

Beocreate 2 comes with several standard interface elements. To ensure consistent look and feel, you should always use the standard elements. Only create custom elements if a relevant standard element is not available.

### Communicate Fluently & Efficiently

Long text labels will go unread by the user – consider whether they are required in the first place, and what you can do to eliminate the need to include them.

If text is required, deliver just the information that's needed, when it's needed, in the simplest way possible. Don't resort to *adspeak* or sugarcoating – the tone of voice should be matter-of-fact, whilst avoiding technical-sounding words where possible.

Use title case in interactive elements. Use sentence case everywhere else. Never type in all caps – the interface will automatically transform text to all caps where needed.

Pay attention to grammar and spelling. Beocreate 2 uses *British English* throughout.

## Symbols

Beocreate 2 uses symbols for various purposes, such as for representing the different extensions in menus. These symbols should follow a consistent style. Examine and be inspired by the built-in symbols!

- Use SVG format with a 21 x 21 pt canvas.
- Use 1 pt strokes with round end-caps and joins.
- Use outlined shapes. Only create solid shapes when absolutely necessary to convey information (for example, the heart in Now Playing is solid when a track is a loved track).
- Don't create coloured symbols. Beocreate 2 will change the colours of the icons as necessary (such as when switching from light to dark mode). You can save both black and white versions of the icon if needed.
- Aim to present the idea with as few strokes as possible, to maintain a minimal and harmonious look.
- Align strokes to the pixel grid. Always preview the symbol in both @1x and @2x scales – it should look crisp and sharp on both standard and Retina (HiDPI) displays.
- Make sure that glyphs are optically aligned and sized. For example, if the main shape is a circle, it should extend all the way to the edges of the canvas. A rectangular shape, on the other hand, should maintain 1 pt distance to the edges. 


## Product Images

To create product images for use with Beocreate 2, follow these guidelines.

- The image should be a flattering, high-quality and detailed representation of the product, in contrast to the various symbols in the user interface.
- An immaculate, near-photorealistic rendering is preferred to a photograph for an iconic feel.
- Pay attention to lighting, materials and textures.
- If the product is self-standing, it should have a subtle shadow. Do not use the shadows from the rendering software, but instead craft the shadow by hand to match the default product images, as the best lighting differs from product to product and can create vastly different shadows.
- Within a product family, consider the relative scale of the individual products to convey size difference. If the difference is very large, it is usually better to enlarge the smaller products to fill more of the canvas (a good example is Beovox 3000/5000 family).
- The entire product and its shadow must fit on the canvas without being cut off in any way.
- Whilst the product will be primarily presented on light backgrounds, ensure that it works on dark backgrounds too. This is especially important to consider if the product contains translucent or reflective parts.
- The image should be a PNG file with the dimensions of 1000 x 1000 pixels and full transparency. For best quality, render at a larger size and scale down. If possible, use an application such as ImageOptim to "crush" the PNG file to a smaller file size.

These guidelines also apply to other rendered illustrations.
